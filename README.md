# StoneIt
It is an encryption decryption software.

This software is named as 'StoneIt' because of the fact that the encrypted file is as hard to use to an outsider as a stone is hard to break and an ordinary stone may look like nothing special but with this stone many nice things can be made. So, we can say that this program can make any nice sculpture to a meaningless stone by encryption and again build the sculpture back from the stone.

This software can encrypt and decrypt any kind of file in some simple ways. The software moreover gives the opportunity to its user to choose any out of numerous ways to decrypt and encrypt his or her file.

In this program one has to select a file and a location where encrypted or decrypted file will be saved. Then he has to give file name with extension and then he has to select any of some given method to encrypt his file and finally press 'Stone It' button.

For decryption one has to select the same method used for encryption and follow same instructions, but this time press 'Build It' button.

Java and Java Swing are used to build this software. So, one must have jre to run this software.
